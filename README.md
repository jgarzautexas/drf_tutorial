**Note**: Full documentation for the project is available at [http://django-rest-framework.org][docs].

# Overview

DRF Tutorial

Some reasons you might want to use REST framework:

* The [Web browseable API][sandbox] is a huge useability win for your developers.
* [Authentication policies][authentication] including [OAuth1a][oauth1-section] and [OAuth2][oauth2-section] out of the box.
* [Serialization][serializers] that supports both [ORM][modelserializer-section] and [non-ORM][serializer-section] data sources.
* Customizable all the way down - just use [regular function-based views][functionview-section] if you don't need the [more][generic-views] [powerful][viewsets] [features][routers].
* [Extensive documentation][index], and [great community support][group].

There is a live example API for testing purposes, [available here][sandbox].
